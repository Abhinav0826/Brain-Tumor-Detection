# Brain-Tumor-Detection using Machine Learning
The Brain Tumor Detection using Support vector machines (SVM) is a machine learning project focused on accurately detecting brain tumors in medical images. By harnessing the power of SVMs, the project aims to automatically learn and extract meaningful features from brain MRI scans, enabling precise and efficient tumor detection.
